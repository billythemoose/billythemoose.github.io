toc:
  sidebar: left

TODO: 

Sidebar needs to be below the title (adding a banner separator? )
TOC doesn't need the page title in it

removing the title from the TOC is possible with focus changes for bootstrap-toc but I'm guessing the css for expand/contract is hardcoded maybe?

still can't get it to do 3 or 4 
seemingly have to just limit it to top level headings / level 2 headings and force the configuration 







Ok so there is the 'jekyll-toc' project that should customize how the TOC works but then there's also the 'bootstrap-toc' project that seems to be altering what can happen with the TOC???? 

holy shit the 'distill' styled blog post is WAY better than this version since it's more customizable seemingly? Unclear how to customize the seemingly conflicting options in the generated toc style 

# Introduction 
Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) comes preloaded with a VNC client 

? What's the VNC Client? 
  RVNC Connect
  Raspberry Pi Edition - Service Mode
? Current version of VNC installed on Raspberry Pi? 
  Raspbian GNU/ Linux 11 (bullseye)
? Ubuntu version? 
  NAME="Ubuntu"
  VERSION_ID="22.04"
  VERSION="22.04.4 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"

Ubuntu 22.04 uses rdp package gnome-remote-desktop

Check if installed 
dpkg (base of Debian-based Linux package management system)
dpkg -l | grep gnome-remote-desktop 
or
apt (tool for simplifying software installation / removal on Debian-based Linux)
apt list --installed | grep gnome-remote-desktop


# Issues with VNC
Why it's bad 

RFB protocol is inherently insecure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing

monitoring access / seeing who currently has access

# Configure SSH Tunnel

# VNC over SSH Configuration






As you may know, GNOME 42 adopted Microsoft RDP protocol for its built-in remote desktop feature. Ubuntu 22.04 Beta previously excluded it because of the bug due to mixed Gnome-control-center and Gnome-remote-desktop versions.
