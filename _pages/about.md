Hi! I am a Software Engineer at Sherpa 6 working on their Enterprise Mobility Management solution for both Android devices and Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) devices. I currently focus on backend development and flex to front end work when available. 

Previously, I worked at Amazon on a host of different projects within Kindle. This included the  [Look Inside](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GHACQBMSMRM3LBQ4) feature of the retail website, the web-based [Kindle Cloud Reader](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GCQEMKHLBENNKWU2),  and the Kindle app for [Mac and PC](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16571048011). I also developed large-scale migrations for backend services supporting online reading and for the Kindle content delivery network. 

I got my start working at Microsoft back when [Windows Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone) still existed. I created software to help manage and recover the hundreds of devices required for build validation and verification.
